 * Migration 018: Remove the legacy "post-processor" service entry.
 *
 * Handler service registration (e.g. pp-atif) is now owned
 * by each worker's handler.yaml + the generic register-handler script,
 * which POSTs to the scheduler's POST /handlers/register endpoint on deploy.
 * Reports are not a DAG handler — the scheduler triggers report generation
 * (POST /api/v1/reports/trigger) once the DAG drains.
 * This migration only cleans up the old single-entry format.
