# Gateway WebSocket Support

The AI gateway proxy supports WebSocket connections through its TLS interception layer. This enables recording of WebSocket traffic (e.g., OpenAI Responses API in streaming mode) alongside regular HTTP exchanges.

## Motivation

VS Code 1.118+ uses WebSocket mode for the OpenAI Responses API (`wss://api.openai.com/v1/responses`). The client opens a persistent WebSocket connection and exchanges JSON events (`response.create`, streamed response chunks, etc.) instead of using HTTP request/response pairs.

Without WebSocket support, the gateway's TLS MITM layer would reject the HTTP Upgrade request, breaking VS Code's ability to use these models.

## Architecture

```
Client (VS Code)
   │ CONNECT api.openai.com:443
   ▼
[Gateway Proxy - CONNECT handler]
   │ TLS MITM (forged cert)
   ▼
[Gateway TLS Interception Layer]
   │ Detects: Connection: Upgrade + Upgrade: websocket
   │ Forwards upgrade to upstream via TLS
   ▼
[Upstream (api.openai.com)]
   │ 101 Switching Protocols
   ▼
[Gateway] ← Bidirectional WebSocket frame relay → [Client]
   │
   └── Records frames as _webSocketMessages in HAR
```

### Flow

1. **Detection**: `is_websocket_upgrade()` checks for `Connection: Upgrade` + `Upgrade: websocket` headers in the intercepted HTTP request.
2. **Upstream Handshake**: Gateway connects to the upstream server via TLS and performs a WebSocket handshake using `tokio-tungstenite`.
3. **Client Upgrade**: Gateway returns HTTP 101 to the client, triggering hyper's upgrade mechanism.
4. **Frame Relay**: A background task relays WebSocket frames bidirectionally between client and upstream while recording each message.
5. **Recording**: On connection close, the recorded messages are reported to plugins as an `HttpExchange` with the messages serialized in the response body.

### Session Lifecycle

- An `InFlightGuard` is held for the entire WebSocket connection duration to prevent session reaping.
- The relay task periodically touches the session (every 30s) to prevent idle timeout.
- Only after the WebSocket closes is the exchange reported to plugins and the guard dropped.

## HAR Format

WebSocket connections are recorded in HAR following Chrome DevTools' convention.

### Entry Structure

Each WebSocket connection produces a single HAR entry:

```json
{
  "startedDateTime": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "time": 5000.0,
  "_resourceType": "websocket",
  "request": {
    "method": "GET",
    "url": "wss://api.openai.com/v1/responses",
    "httpVersion": "HTTP/1.1",
    "headers": [
      { "name": "upgrade", "value": "websocket" },
      { "name": "connection", "value": "Upgrade" },
      { "name": "sec-websocket-key", "value": "..." },
      { "name": "sec-websocket-version", "value": "13" }
    ],
    "headersSize": -1,
    "bodySize": 0
  },
  "response": {
    "status": 101,
    "statusText": "Switching Protocols",
    "httpVersion": "HTTP/1.1",
    "headers": [
      { "name": "upgrade", "value": "websocket" },
      { "name": "connection", "value": "Upgrade" }
    ],
    "content": { "size": 0, "mimeType": "x-unknown" },
    "headersSize": -1,
    "bodySize": 0
  },
  "_webSocketMessages": [
    { "type": "send", "time": 1705312200.123, "opcode": 1, "data": "{\"type\":\"response.create\",...}" },
    { "type": "receive", "time": 1705312200.456, "opcode": 1, "data": "{\"type\":\"response.created\",...}" },
    { "type": "receive", "time": 1705312200.789, "opcode": 1, "data": "{\"type\":\"response.output_item.added\",...}" }
  ]
}
```

### `_webSocketMessages` Fields

| Field | Values | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `type` | `"send"` / `"receive"` | Direction: client→server or server→client |
| `time` | Unix timestamp (f64) | Seconds since epoch with millisecond precision |
| `opcode` | `1` (text) / `2` (binary) | WebSocket frame opcode |
| `data` | string | Message payload (text for opcode 1, base64 for opcode 2) |

### What's NOT Recorded

- Ping/pong frames (control frames, not application data)
- Close frames (connection lifecycle, not content)

This matches Chrome DevTools behavior.

### Downstream consumers (judge tool-call extraction)

The judge's HAR parser reads these frames when reconstructing an agent's tool-call
history. `extractToolCalls` (`packages/shared/src/har/har-parser.ts`) calls
`extractResponsesApiFromWebSocketMessages` (`responses-api-parser.ts`) for every entry that
carries `_webSocketMessages`:

- **`send`** frames are the client's `response.create` messages; their top-level `input[]`
  transcript (accumulated `function_call` / `custom_tool_call` calls plus their
  `function_call_output` / `custom_tool_call_output` results) is fed to the same
  request-body extractor used for HTTP.
- **`receive`** frames are the server's streamed events (e.g. `response.output_item.done`);
  they are the same objects as SSE `data:` payloads and are fed to the same response-body
  extractor.
- Binary frames (`opcode 2`) and any malformed / non-JSON payloads are skipped.

Because this reuses the existing Responses-API semantic parsers and is gated purely on the
**presence** of `_webSocketMessages`, it is a no-op for HTTP-only (DevProxy) HARs. Before
this transport unwrapping was added (#1253), gpt-5.x runs whose `/responses` traffic lived
entirely in WebSocket frames produced an **empty** tool-call history even though the
payloads were present in the HAR. See
[`docs/design/gates.md`](../design/gates.md) for how tool-call evidence feeds the gates.

## Plugin API Mapping

The gateway's plugin system receives WebSocket connections as `HttpExchange`:

- `exchange.request`: The HTTP Upgrade request (method=GET, URI, headers including WS headers, empty body)
- `exchange.response`: Status 101, Upgrade headers, **body = JSON-serialized `_webSocketMessages` array**
- `exchange.started_at`: When the upgrade request was sent
- `exchange.wait_ms`: Time to receive 101 from upstream
- `exchange.elapsed_ms`: Total WebSocket connection lifetime

The HAR plugin detects WebSocket exchanges (status 101 + `Upgrade: websocket`) and:
1. Sets `_resourceType: "websocket"` on the entry
2. Deserializes the response body into `_webSocketMessages`
3. Sets response content size to 0 (messages are in the custom field, not the content)

## Cross-Cutting Feature Parity

The WebSocket path supports all protocol-agnostic features available on the HTTPS and SSE paths. See the [cross-cutting feature table in the main gateway docs](./ai-gateway.md#proxy-data-plane) for the full comparison.

The only addition specific to WebSocket is the **periodic 30s session touch** during the relay loop, since WS connections are long-lived whereas HTTP responses complete quickly enough that a single touch on completion suffices.
