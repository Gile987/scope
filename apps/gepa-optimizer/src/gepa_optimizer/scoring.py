"""Pure, side-effect-free scoring of a finished Scope run.

The GEPA metric is **derived, never persisted in Scope**: Scope stores the raw
``run.turns[].criteriaResults`` and the run ``outcome``; we compute the
fraction of requested criteria that passed and aggregate it across turns.

Design decisions (see plan §C2/§D and the rubber-duck critique):

* The denominator is the number of **requested** criteria, not the number of
  results Scope happened to return. This is robust even if Scope ever omits
  skipped criteria from ``criteriaResults`` — a requested criterion with no
  passing result always counts as failed.
* ``evaluated == False`` (a DAG ancestor failed, so the criterion was skipped)
  counts as **failed**, amplifying the penalty for early failures.
* A run is scored by its criteria fraction whenever it **completed and was
  judged** — i.e. ``outcome`` is ``"succeeded"`` (all criteria passed) **or**
  ``"finished"`` (ran to ``maxIterations`` and was judged, but not all criteria
  passed). Scoring only ``"succeeded"`` runs would collapse the optimization
  landscape to ``0.0`` until a candidate passes *every* criterion, destroying
  the partial-credit gradient GEPA relies on. A run that ``"failed"`` (errored
  or abandoned the task before being judged to completion), has no turns, or has
  no judged criteria scores ``0.0``. The function never returns ``NaN``.
