"""Post-hoc lineage reconstruction from a GEPA result.

The rubber-duck critique flagged that capturing parent→child lineage *during*
evaluation (via a custom ``propose_new_texts``) is fragile: it requires
reimplementing GEPA's reflection proposer and races on shared state. Instead we
reconstruct the candidate DAG **after** ``gepa.optimize`` returns, from the
public ``result.parents`` (a ``list[list[int]]`` of parent indices per
candidate) and ``result.candidates``. This uses only GEPA's documented result
surface and cannot corrupt the optimization.

The reconstructed edges are written to ``results.json`` for inspection. The
Scope ``requests.agentsMdParentIds`` field remains available for callers that
*do* know parentage at submit time, but the optimizer does not depend on it.
